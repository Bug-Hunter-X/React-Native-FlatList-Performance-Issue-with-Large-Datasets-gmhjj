# React Native FlatList Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a performance issue with React Native's FlatList component when rendering a large number of items.  The app becomes unresponsive and may crash.  The solution implemented uses `windowSize` and `initialNumToRender` to improve performance.  See `bugSolution.js` for the improved implementation.
